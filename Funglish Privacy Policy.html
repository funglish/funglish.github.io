  <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="privacy-policy"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 28/01/2025</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing <strong>Funglish</strong> (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how and why we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our App. By using Funglish, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>App Name</strong>: Funglish</li>
<li><strong>Developer/Publisher</strong>: Funglish</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Children ages 7 to 10 (and general audience interested in learning English)</li>
<li><strong>Primary Purpose</strong>: Provide an educational companion to the physical Funglish tabletop game, by scanning QR codes and offering translations, images, and read-aloud functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution</strong>: The App is currently distributed only in Israel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Funglish does <strong>not</strong> require users to create an account, provide personal information, or subscribe. The App is fully accessible once downloaded and installed, although functionality is optimized for use alongside the physical tabletop game.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="personal-data-collection-and-use">2. Personal Data Collection and Use</h2>
<h3 id="no-collection-of-personal-information">2.1 No Collection of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process <strong>any</strong> personal information (such as name, email address, phone number, location, etc.) from users. We also do not knowingly request or collect personal data from children under any age, including those under 13.</p>
<h3 id="data-generated-within-the-app">2.2 Data Generated Within the App</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>QR Code Scanning</strong>: The App scans <strong>only</strong> the predefined, hardcoded QR codes found in the physical Funglish materials. These scans simply trigger the display or playing of localized text, images, and audio. No information from the QR code scans is collected or transmitted to any external server.</li>
<li><strong>Downloaded Media Files</strong>: For the second tabletop package, users can download images and audio files from our private resource server. These files are stored locally on the user’s device. We do <strong>not</strong> collect or track any data about which files are downloaded or how users interact with the files.</li>
<li><strong>Language Preference</strong>: The App detects the device’s locale (via <code>READ_PHONE_STATE</code>) during the first launch to suggest the most appropriate interface language. This preference can be changed manually in the App’s settings. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, share, or transmit any data about user locale.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-third-party-services-or-sdks">2.3 No Third-Party Services or SDKs</h3>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> integrate or use any third-party analytics tools, advertising SDKs, or tracking systems. Funglish operates independently without sending user data to external services.</p>

<li>We take reasonable measures to secure any data stored locally by the App, but please note that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Users can delete these files at any time by clearing the App’s data or uninstalling the App.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="child-directed-app-compliance">5. Child-Directed App Compliance</h2>
<p>Funglish is designed for children ages 7–10 (and up). We are committed to protecting children’s privacy and safety:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data from children.</li>
<li>We do <strong>not</strong> serve ads or use any in-app purchases.</li>
<li>All content is educational and appropriate for children.</li>

<p>Since the App is distributed only in Israel, we follow applicable local regulations. However, if you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal data, please contact us immediately, and we will take all necessary steps to remove such information.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="third-party-sharing-and-disclosure">6. Third-Party Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

<hr>
<h2 id="data-retention-and-deletion">7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

<h2 id="international-users">8. International Users</h2>
<p>Funglish is currently available only in Israel. If you use or access the App from outside Israel (for instance, by side-loading the App or traveling), note that we do not collect personal data and therefore do not transfer user data across borders.</p>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will post the updated policy within the App or on our official website (if available) and indicate the “Effective Date” at the top.</p>
